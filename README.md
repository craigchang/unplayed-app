# unplayed-app

> A Vue.js project

## Description

A UI re-design of the original Unplayed created by Shaun Inman (https://shauninman.com/archive/2011/04/18/unplayed). Instead of PHP, it uses Vue.js as a progressive js framework and showdown.js (https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown), a markdown parser that converts markdown text to html
